## Features

* About the calculator:
    * Basic calculations - addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
    * Clear All and Delete buttons - the user can clear all the display or delete one digit if a typo has been made
    * Single pair of numbers evaluation - every time the user presses a basic operator, the calculator calculates the operation and stores the result as operand of the following operation
    * Floating numbers - the calculator can make calculations with decimals
    * Percentage - the user can make complicated calculations using percentage
    * Keyboard support - while TouchScreen users can click on button to insert input and get output, the Desktop user can use the keyboard keys

* About the design
    * It is responsive on all devices, however it's not good for 4K screens as the sizes could be disturbing
    * Mobile first design approach


## What I learned
